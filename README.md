# Propel Tech - Address Book

This repository contains the code for a simple address book application, built using React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `step1` folder and run `npm start` in your terminal to start the initial program.

2. The final code for the application is organized into two folders:

   - `front`: Contains the HTML, CSS, and React components for the front-end.
   - `backend`: Contains the database implementation (Address Book object with Contact objects) and the API.

3. To run the main program, navigate to the `backend` folder and run `npm run app` in your terminal. This will start the server and run the files from the `frontend` folder as well.

4. Unit tests for the classes and API are located in the `test_files` folder inside the `backend` folder. To run the tests, navigate to the `backend` folder and run `npm run test` in your terminal.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Node.js
- Express
- Mocha (for testing classes)
- Supertest (for testing API)
